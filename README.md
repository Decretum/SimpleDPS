# SimpleDPS
Originally created to compare DPS of STAB Dragonite/Tyranitar movesets

This is just a simple program that I threw together when I was bored. 

It can be modified to compare other moveset combinations as well. 

One thing it doesn't account for is differences in the attack stat of different Pokemon, as well as rounding due to the defender's defense stat.
